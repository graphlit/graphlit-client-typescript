# Test Suite Consolidation Summary

## Overview

The TypeScript SDK test suite has been consolidated from 40+ test files down to 10 well-organized test files to improve maintainability and reduce pre-release testing time.

## Final Test Suite Structure (10 files)

### 1. **comprehensive-integration.test.ts**

- Main integration tests across all supported LLM providers
- Tests streaming, tool calling, and performance metrics
- Core test suite for pre-release validation

### 2. **tool-calling-suite.test.ts**

Consolidated from 9 files:

- Multiple tool calls
- Tool call limits
- Tool response handling (including null responses)
- Complex tool schemas
- Duplicate tool call prevention
- Tool orchestration scenarios

### 3. **reasoning-suite.test.ts**

Consolidated from 4 files:

- Basic reasoning detection
- Anthropic extended thinking support
- Reasoning with stream cancellation
- Format detection (XML vs Markdown)

### 4. **conversation-suite.test.ts**

Consolidated from 4 files:

- Multi-turn conversations
- Multi-turn with tools
- Concurrent conversations
- Conversation continuity

### 5. **provider-specific.test.ts**

Consolidated from 6 files:

- Bedrock-specific features and tool calling
- Deepseek streaming and reasoning
- Mistral streaming and tool handling
- Groq high-speed streaming
- Cohere v2 API handling

### 6. **ingestion-suite.test.ts**

Consolidated from 5 files:

- File size limit testing
- Various file types (text, JSON, CSV)
- Sync vs async ingestion
- Error handling
- Special characters and encoding

### 7. **streaming-features.test.ts**

Consolidated from 8 files:

- Stream cancellation
- Streaming without tool calls
- Multimodal streaming
- Error recovery
- Content filtering
- Large response handling
- Context window tracking

### 8. **performance-tests.test.ts**

- Performance benchmarking
- Streaming performance characteristics
- Token timing metrics

### 9. **prerelease-gate.test.ts**

- Comprehensive pre-release validation
- Critical path testing for v1.2.0 features

### 10. **validation-suite.test.ts**

Consolidated from 3 files:

- Quick provider validation
- README example validation
- API method validation

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Test Execution Time**: Fewer files mean less overhead and faster test runs
2. **Better Organization**: Related tests are now grouped logically
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Updates to test patterns only need to be made in one place
4. **Clearer Coverage**: It's easier to see what's being tested and identify gaps
5. **Simplified Pre-release Process**: Running 10 focused test suites is more manageable than 40+ scattered files

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run a specific test suite:

```bash
npm test tool-calling-suite.test.ts
```

To run only the quick validation:

```bash
npm test validation-suite.test.ts
```

## Notes

- All test coverage has been preserved during consolidation
- Tests use the same patterns and utilities as before
- Provider-specific quirks and edge cases are still tested
- Performance and benchmarking capabilities remain intact
